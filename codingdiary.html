    <h2>Monday 4th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Ruby started to ease up today as we have started doing a lot of revision, we got to submit ideas for the Terminal App and a partner (if we had one in mind), they are submitted in the evening and we find out in the morning if they're acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home unwell after hanging on all day feeling like the walking dead, so left it with the capable Tristan to submit  our DatingApp idea.
    </p>

    <h2>Tuesday 5th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Big day today, our idea was accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We spent the morning on a Git revision, and while I am starting to understand the benefits of Git for version control the horribly counterintuitive nature of it drives me crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then after half a day of Git and Assignment guidlines we get to start working on it, while in retrospect I panicked a bit we ended up completing our basic application by 6pm.
    </p>
    <p>
      We both decided that we just needed something functional to present and we achieved that by the end of the day.
    </p>

    <h2>Wednesday 6th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Making the app look pretty sums up the day, we gradually decided to add things to the app, such as the ascii art and the chat feature at the end of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things I would work on next are the PowerPoint side of the presentation, we had time but didnt spend too much time on that.
    </p>

    <h2>Thursday 7th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Today Tristan and I presented our DatingApp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilarity ensues, as is evident below.

    <h2>Friday 8th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Ruby Test, pretty sure I passed lol.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we wrap up the 3 week stint of Ruby we started to touch on the following weeks learning of HTML and CSS with an introduction to UI and UX.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example of Apple design can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/" style="color:mediumvioletred">here</a>, while we installed <a href="https://www.figma.com" style="color:mediumvioletred">Figma</a> to start planning for wireframes
    </p>

    <h2>Monday 11th March 2019</h2>

    <h2>Tuesday 12th March 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Today was the start of start of learning the origins of the internet and how it works (cute note: it was the internets 30th birthday)
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we started HTML and CSS, hence I am starting this diary now and will backfill as much as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must decide on my next presentation topic, topic of my choosing that i can present for 5 mins.
    </p>
      <h3>Topics I am considering</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Philosophy and Nier: Automata</li>
        <li>Level design of Dark Souls</li>
        <li>Coping with depression and anxiety as a Coder</li>
        <li>Growing bananas</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
    P.S. while fucking around today I managed to gay up my computer terminal app, just a little.
